# Wallpapers

My collection of artist commissioned wallpapers. Every wallpaper in this
collection has been hand picked, and commissioned from various artists.

## Goals

Create a collection of wallpapers that simultaneously helps fund great artists
and creators. Later on, if this ever gains traction outside of myself, id love
to start some sort of kickback for artists via something similar to buy me a
coffee.

## Repo Format

- All the wallpapers live inside ./wallpapers
- All wallpapers are named after the work name the artist gives
- All artists are listed alphabetical in `ARTISTS.md` with the list of their
  pieces and their socials

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, however you must include the following

- Artist name
- Artist handle on X
- Artwork (Wallpaper format, 16x9)
- Proof work is commissioned and paid for, or that is created by you as an
  artist.
